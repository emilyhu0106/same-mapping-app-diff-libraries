# Same web mapping application, Difference libraries

Whether you are adding a map to simply show locations on your web page or building a fully featured web mapping application for your spatial intelligence need, web mapping libraries are helpful places to start the development journey. In this five-part blog series, we will build the same web mapping applications using different popular libraries, then discussing key points related to building with that library.

## The goal
With this five-part blog series, we are hoping to achieve:

Showing implementation patterns of common workflows by creating the same app in popular mapping libraries.
- The libraries are: ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript, Leaflet, MapLibre GL JS, and OpenLayers
- Determining and closing the gaps between libraries, so that developers can have smooth migrations.
- Illustrating the different implementation patterns for the libraries and their most suitable use cases

## This repo
This repo contains code for the apps in this project.
### ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript
